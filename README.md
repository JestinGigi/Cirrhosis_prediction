### Age/Gender Dependency on Severity
- The above visualization provides insights into the dependence of cirrhosis severity on an individual's gender. Based on the graph and recent studies, it is observed that males are more prone to cirrhosis. This may indicate poor lifestyle choices, unhealthy eating habits, and compromised physical/mental health.
- Cirrhosis is a condition characterized by the scarring of the liver, leading to liver dysfunction. As individuals age, their liver function naturally declines, as depicted in the visualizations below.
